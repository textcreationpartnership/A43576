            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FOR your ſakes (dear Friends) I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume again to appear upon the publick Stage, to be your faithful <hi>Monitor,</hi> to prompt you to your duty, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Work of God in your own Souls, and the Worſhip of God in your Families: And I know not how a Miniſter can imploy his Time, and Studies, and Pen better (next to the Conviction and Converſion of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Souls) than preſſing upon Houſholders a care of the Souls under their charge: This hath a direct tendency to publick Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Religion begins in Individuals, and paſſeth on to Relatives; and leſſer Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives make up greater. Churches and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths conſiſt of Families. There is a general complaint of the great decay of the Power of Godlineſs, and Inundation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs; and not without cauſe: I know no better Remedy than Domeſtick Piety: Did Governours teach their Inferiours by Counſels and Examples; did they ſeverely diſcountenance and reſtrain Enormities, and preſs Holineſs, and then call on God united<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:61695:3"/> and affectionately, that he would effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly work what they cannot effect; who can tell what a bleſſed alteration would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low? In vain do you complain of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Miniſters, while you that are Houſholders are unfaithful to your Truſt: You complain, the World is naught; what do you to mend it? Do not ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of others, as of your ſelves; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain not ſo much to Man as to God, and plead with him for Reformation, and ſecond your Prayers with earneſt Endeavours: Sweep before your own doors: Act for God within your ſphear: As you have more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of familiarity with Houſe-fellows, ſo you have more authority over them by their dependance on you, to influence them; and if you improve not this Talent, you will have a dreadful account to give, eſpecially when their blood will be required at your hands, becauſe their ſin will be charged on your neglect. Oh Sirs! have you not ſins enough of your own, but you muſt eſpouſe the guilt of your whole Families? It's you that make bad Times, and bring down Judgments on the Nation. Would you ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee your Children frying, and hear them crying in Hell Torments, than ſpeak a word to them for their inſtruction, hear them cry under your correction, or cry to God for their Salvation? Oh cruel Tygers, and barbarous Monſters! You may conceit your ſelves to be Chriſtians; but I cannot judge that Man worthy to be a fit Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant

            <p>They that know the Reverend Author of this Work, or have peruſed (with deſire to profit) thoſe pious practical Treatiſes, which he hath formerly Publiſhed, will think (as we do) that there is no need of any Letters Commendatory to bespeak thy favourable acceptance of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe: The deſign of which is to perſwade and engage thoſe that are Heads and Governours of Families, to take up <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; that whatever others do, yet <hi>they and their Houſes will ſerve the Lord,</hi> in daily faithful fervent Prayer, with Thanksgiving.</p>
            <p>It is a word in ſeaſon: For 'tis a common Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and that too, by many, who are not a little guilty of it themſelves; That the Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
<pb facs="tcp:61695:6"/> the Life of Practical Religion, is at this day under a lamentable decay: And amongſt the many Cauſes of this decay, there is ſcarcely any that hath been more perniciouſly influential thereunto, than the neglect of Family-Worſhip of God, which is one moſt proper means to promote Seriouſneſs in Religion: Frequent ſolemn Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to God, having a tendency to keep God in remembrance, and to cauſe the Apprehenſions of God to make the deeper impreſſion, and to have the ſtronger influence upon the hearts of thoſe who have not quite loſt all ſenſe of a God, or forgotten that they have Souls to ſave, or loſe. Prayer alſo being a means of God's appointment, to obtain Family Bleſſings and Mercies, (as well as Perſonal and National,) according to the many Promiſes which God hath made of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Acceptance of the Prayers that are put up unto him in the Name of Chriſt, with upright hearts. To thoſe that ſincerely love God, and have wiſdom to judge of things as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to Eternity; the Duty commended in this Treatiſe, will appear, not only to be a neceſſary Duty, but a precious Priviledge, and gracious Vouchſafement: For there are two things which do especially render a Chriſtians continuance in the World deſirable and comfortable to him; the one is, that he may acquaint himſelf with God, and enjoy ſome ſweet Communion with him, (which is a beginning and foretaſt of Heaven whilſt we are here on Earth.) They that are utter ſtrangers to this, have no cauſe to think, that they are as yet made meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in
<pb facs="tcp:61695:6"/> Light. The other deſirable End or Buſineſs of a Chriſtians Life is, that he may be ſerviceable to God, by promoting his Glory and Intereſt in the World, eſpecially by furthering the ſpiritual Good, and Salvation of Souls; both theſe do meet together in the conſcientious practice of this Duty. Firſt; Communion with God: When the Head and Master of a Family (who is as Prophet, Prieſt and Ruler in his Family) doth joyntly with his Children and Servants (as a little Church of God in his Houſe) offer up daily Sacrifice of Prayer, Praiſe and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving unto God, the Author of their Beings, the God of their Lives, and the giver of every good gift wherewith their Lives are ſweetned: And does alſo receive from him Communications of Grace and Mercy; for our bountiful God will never be behind-hand with thoſe that ſeek him in truth, but giveth liberally to them that ask in Faith.</p>
            <p>Secondly; Serviceableneſs unto God, in train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Family in the fear of God; God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bearing witneſs how greatly acceptable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Religiouſneſs is unto him, in that high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, which he hath recorded of <hi>Abraham; I know him,</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>that he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Children, and his Houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the Way of the Lord.</hi> 'Tis a Duty that is both Work and Wages; a Service, that carries its Reward with it (Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, not of Debt, but of Grace,) it brings a Bleſſing upon a Family, as the Ark did on the Houſe of <hi>Obed-Edom;</hi> when on the contrary, dreadful <hi>Wrath</hi> is imprecated to be <hi>poured out
<pb facs="tcp:61695:7"/> upon the Families that call not on the Name of God,</hi> Jer. <hi>10.25.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reader, if thou be one that liveſt in the daily exerciſe, and due performance of this Duty of Family-Prayer, thy own experience of the ſpiritual Benefits and Advantages of it, will enable thee to ſet to thy Seal to what the God of Truth hath ſpoken in his Word. <hi>I never ſaid to the Seed of</hi> Jacob (Iſraelites indeed, that know how to wraſtle with God,) <hi>ſeek ye my face in vain.</hi> But if being a Maſter of a Family, thou be a ſtranger to this duty, either through ſlothfulneſs, multiplicity of buſineſs, or prejudice and diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the Duty; the Reverend Author hath ſaid enough to convince thee, that it is thy Duty; and if convinced hereof, thou wilt continue in the wilful neglect of thy known duty, thou doſt in effect ſay with thoſe in <hi>Jer. 44 16. As for the Word which thou haſt ſpoken to us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee;</hi> What an aggravation will this be of thy ſin! <hi>For to him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin,</hi> Jam. <hi>4.17.</hi> i. e. exceeding ſinful; and alſo of thy puniſhment; for <hi>that Servant which knew his Lords will, and prepared not himſelf, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes,</hi> Luk. <hi>12.47.</hi> That the one and the other may be prevented, and thou mayeſt be prevailed with conſcientiouſly to practiſe this Duty, is the deſign of this Treatiſe, and the hearty deſire of</p>

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> That Governours of Families muſt as Prieſts erect Family-Altars for God's Worſhip.</head>
                  <p>It well becomes Houſholders or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Families, to ſet up and maintain Family-Altars for worſhiping of God, in and with the Members of their Families.</p>
                  <p>As holy <hi>Jacob</hi> the famous Patriarch was a Prophet to inſtruct his Family in the true
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61695:16"/> Religion, and a King to Govern them for God; ſo a Prieſt to ſet up an Altar, offer Sacrifices and perform Religious Worſhip for and with his Family: Yea the pooreſt man that hath a Family is to be Prophet, Prieſt and King in his own Houſe.</p>
                  <p>God commands <hi>Jacob</hi> to build an Altar at <hi>Bethel, Jacob</hi> reſolves upon it, and gives all his Family orders how to behave themſelves in managing this important affair; and when they did their duty, God ſecured them, they journeyed and paſſed on ſafely.</p>
                  <p>Let none ſay that this ſetting up an Altar by <hi>Jacob</hi> was but ordered upon this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar occaſion of his paying his Vows formerly made at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and ſo doth not oblige us?</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, 1. It's true this circumſtance of the place, occaſion, and this ſolemnity are perſonal and particular but the duty is, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, moral and prepetual, as I ſhall prove it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Jacob</hi> doubtleſs worſhipt God with his Family in all places where he had come, as he took the fear of God with him in his heart, ſo he left not the external practice of Religion behind him: But ſet up Gods Worſhip which was equivalent to an Altar in all places where he came, as his Father <hi>Iſaac</hi> and his Grand-father <hi>Abraham</hi> had done.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And may not we have the like occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as he had to rear an Altar? Have we had no mercies from God? Do we lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no Vows, or at leaſt, Obligations to the Lord? And do not theſe preſidents, and general rules bind us to the like practice, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61695:16"/> we have a particular command by a voice from Heaven, or in an extraordinary way? I ſhall evince the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe <hi>Jacob</hi> was left alone, and wreſtled with the Angel and prevailed upon an extraordinary occaſion, <hi>Gen</hi> 32.24 <hi>i. e.</hi> the fear he had of his Brother <hi>Eſau:</hi> Shall we think that <hi>Jacob</hi> never prayed alone, but when he was in the like hazard?

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61695:17"/> there are four things requiſite.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Inſtitution or Conſecration; none can appoint an Altar to be Erected but God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.24. <hi>An Altar of Earth ſhalt thou make:</hi> None hath Power to order Gods Worſhip but himſelf alone: Men may not add or diminiſh at their pleaſure:<note place="margin">Mat. 28.20.</note> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters muſt teach, Chriſtians muſt obſerve all things whatſoever our Lord command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us:<note place="margin">Numb. 7.10.</note> Men may Dedicate an Altar, It is God alone that properly Conſecrates or Sanctifies it; yet men are ſaid to Conſecrate themſelves to the Lord,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 29.31, 33.</note> yea and other things in a ſecondary way, and inſtrumentally: But as God appoints, ſo himſelf only doth Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively, efficiently, actually, Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate Perſons and things: Let us ſee we have a warrant from God for what we do in his Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An Altar requires a Prieſt: Before <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, the Firſt-born of the Family was Prieſt to offer on the Altar; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Good took the Tribe of Levi inſtead of the Firſt-born, in remembrance of the Lords ſmiting the Firſt-born in <hi>Egypt, Num.</hi> 3.12.13.<note place="margin">Num. 17.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Family were the bloſſoming rod whom God had choſe in a peculiar manner to Miniſter before him: But our Lord Jeſus is our New Teſtament <hi>Aaron,</hi> yet above him, even after the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Melchizedeck;</hi>

                  <hi>acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A Prieſt muſt needs have ſomething to offer upon this Altar.<note place="margin">Heb. 8.3, 4.</note> The Prieſts under the Law offered Bulls, Goats, and brute Beaſts: Chriſt offered himſelf as a Sacrifice for our ſins: Saints offer their Souls and Bodies as a Thank-offering to the Lord; their prayer and praiſes, as was hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: But the Holy Ghoſt adviſeth us to be more ready to hear, than to give the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of fools, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1. or than fools to give Sacrifice, who vainly think to pleaſe God with variety and coſtlineſs of their Offerings. <hi>Obedience is better than Sacrifice;</hi> and <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord;</hi> therefore it becomes us all to look to our ſtate and ſtanding and alſo to the manner of ſacrificing, as well as the matter ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed.</p>

               <p>If it be inquired, how muſt an Houſholder act the part of a Prieſt in his Family? what muſt he do? Anſwer; The office and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of a Prieſt in the Old Teſtament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in theſe four things chiefly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To inſtruct the People in the Principles of Religion, and their duty to God and each other; <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. <hi>The Prieſts lips ſhould keep knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth:</hi> Therefore God rejected thoſe Prieſts that rejected knowledge; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.6.

               <p n="3">3. The Prieſt was to intercede for the People, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was to take a Cenſer, and put fire thereon from the Altar, and put on Incenſe—and ſtood between the dead and living,<note place="margin">Nam quoties in Sanctum ingredieba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Sacerdos, quaſi in Dei conſpectum prodibat, ut inter eum &amp; populum eſſet Mediator. <hi>Calv. in loc.</hi>

Hence the Prieſts Office was to burn Incenſe in the Temple, and the multitude of the People were pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without, at the time of Incenſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.9, 10. For as often as the Prieſt entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the holy place, he appeared as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, that he might be a Mediator between God and the People. It's true, there is no Mediator of Interceſſion, no more than of Redemption betwixt God and Sinners, but Jeſus Chriſt alone in a proper ſenſe; yet as one may pray and prevail for another through Chriſt, ſo a godly Houſhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may and muſt be the mouth of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily on their behalf.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

                  <hi>Chap. IV.</hi> Objections propoſed and anſwered that militate againſt Family-Altars.</head>
               <p>BUT there is no Truth ſo plain, no Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo good, but Satan can furniſh a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty head, and wicked heart with plauſible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments againſt it: And it's ſtrange if men have not ſomething to ſay againſt this Duty, that apparently tends to undermine Satan's Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>Had Family-prayer been a Duty, we had found it expreſly commanded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but we find it not in any expreſs Precept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Where find you Infant-Baptiſm expreſly commanded in the N. Teftam.? yet it is plain by neceſſary conſequence, ſo is this. Circumciſion was commanded; there's the like Reaſon for Baptiſm; both are plain to all but perverſe ſpirits. I hinted before that proper conſequence is ſtrong Argument.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let not proud Reaſon dictate to the wiſe God how he muſt ſpeak. General Rules laid down in Scripture are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to particular Caſes, by Nature and Reaſon in ſeveral circumſtances. If God
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61695:30"/> ſay Men muſt provide for their families, he leaves it to their diſcretion, what kind of Meat, Cloaths, Lodging, Callings they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide. God bids us pray without ceaſing, in all places, all manner of prayer, and leaves it to prudence for particular places, times, words, company, ſo that it anſwer the main End of God's Glory, Communion with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and Edification. Let not captious Wits pick quarrels to evacuate the ſubſtance of a Duty, becauſe the circumſtance is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt. God gives Laws to Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and indulgeth us ſo far as to leave us to our liberty in mutable circumſtances, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept expreſly preſcribed.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt prayed not with his family, yet he is the best Pattern; if he had prayed with them constantly, they would have learned from him, but they want to be taught,</hi> Luk. 11.1.</p>

Chriſt's caſe and ours are far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; what was ſuitable to his Diſciples was not proper to him; he needed not for himſelf to confeſs ſin, ask forgiveneſs, beg mortification, increaſe of grace, aſſurance; ſo that it was not neceſſary that he ſhould ordinarily be their mouth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet Scripture-ſilence is no good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And their deſire of inſtruction in Prayer is no good Argument he Prayed not with them; for Prayer is a Perſonal Duty, And our Lord could not be always with them: And yet we find our Lord did occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally Pray with his Family: In Gratitude,

God loſeth not his Authority to Command, becauſe man hath loſt his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to Obey; it is his Duty ſtill, though he cannot perform it in ſuch a due manner as God requires: He is bound to Pray as a Creature though he cannot do it as a Child: Better do it as men can, than not do it at all; Prayer is a natural duty:<note place="margin">Jonah 3.8.</note> The <hi>Ninevites</hi> muſt cry aloud, and mightily to God, and it was not in vain:<note place="margin">Act. 8.22.</note>

Prayer is the Souls motion God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, deſire is the Soul of Prayer, and who

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.

               <p n="2">2. Prayer is Gods inſtitution to make bad good, ſome have been much wrought upon by the Prayers of others, God heard <hi>Stephen</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> in time; if it advantaged not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Forms are not ſimply condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but Forms only, wanting the power of Godlineſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 5. Our buſineſs is not to make Hypocrites but Converts: By Form is meant a Mask, Vizor or Appearance op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Subſtance and Reality: But we perſuade and direct to ſincerity, as to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, Manner and End of Religious Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes.</p>

                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:61695:32"/>2. But a Form of Golineſs is better than none at all: Men cannot have the Power of Godlineſs without the Form; no more than you can have the Kernell without the Shell: He that Prays doth ſomething to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Duty, but he that refuſeth to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God at all, bids open defiance to God's Commanding Authority, and ſaith; I ſcorn to bow ſo much as a Knee to God in Prayer: This is a preſumptuous Sin:<note place="margin">Pſal. 10.4.</note> 
                  <hi>The wicked through the pride of his heart will not ſeek after God.</hi> Let him anſwer it as he dare: The Text ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 8. <hi>Bodily Exerciſe profiteth lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Object. 6. <hi>But ſuch kind of Praying Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Evening is a ſtinting the Spirit, a limiting God to mans time, when the Spirit moves not to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Chriſt and his Apoſtles had ſet times for Prayer; Jeſus oft times reſorted into the Garden, <hi>Judas</hi> knew his ſtated hour and place, <hi>John</hi> 18.2. <hi>And the Apoſtles had an hour of Prayer,</hi> Acts 3.1. Was this ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Spirit? Indeed this Objection is le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled againſt Preaching, Singing, Supper, and all ſtated Ordinances, how do men know that the Spirit will move at ſuch a ſeaſon?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It's one thing to ſtint, another to lie
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61695:32"/> in the walk of the Spirit: Men are bound to wait at the poſts of Wiſdoms Doors, and are bleſſed,<note place="margin">Prov. 8.34.</note> and in the road of further bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; for the wind of the Spirit bloweth where and when it liſteth:<note place="margin">Joh. 3.8.</note> And no body will ſay he limits the wind that waits in the Heaven for a fair gale to waſt him over: Beſides,<note place="margin">Iſa. 64.7.</note> God expects that men ſhould ſtir up themſelves to take hold on God: Self-excitation is God's appointment to get the heart into frame.

               <p>Object. 7. <hi>This Family-Prayer is but a ſingular invention of brain-ſick novelliſts, not uſed of old, and is more adoe than needs.</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="4">4. If a Law were impoſed upon you to pay five Shillings a time, that you neglect Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in your Family, would you forfeit that ſumme <hi>[toties quoties]</hi> as oft as you go Prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

               <p n="10">10. Suppoſe a Gallows were ſet at your door, and you muſt be hanged thereupon the next time you go out of your door, when you have not Prayed in your Family; would you venture to be hanged rather than omit this duty? do you love your lives no better? Oh! but Eternal death is far more dreadfull, and are Eternal torments,<note place="margin">Rev. 21.8.</note> that lake that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with fire &amp; Brimſtone nothing to you? is the ſecond death eaſie? and ſhall not Sinners be damned for their Omiſſion of good, as well as Commiſſion of Evil?

Fear, worſhip? are not the Souls of your Families preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; is not heaven worth your ſeeking, having?</p>
               <p>Oh! ſay you, I would fain ſet up an Altar in my Family to the Lord; I would offer him a Sacrifice, and Worſhip God, but I
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61695:53"/> know not how to ſet about it, or manage it to any purpoſe ſo as may be acceptable to God, profitable to my Family, or comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my own Soul, I Pray you give me ſome directions on this behalf; I anſwer that I ſhall very willingly, but firſt I do ſolemnly require your promiſe to ſet about it in the name and ſtrength of Chriſt, and do thy beſt you can to do it right: my Inſtructions I ſhall reduce to two heads.</p>

               <p>For the Preparatives to your ſetting up this Family Altar, I ſhall but give you theſe four. 1. See your heads and hearts be well ſtock't; your heads with ſound Knowledge, and your hearts with Saving-Grace: without either of theſe you'll not be fit for this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; without the former you'll have no skill, without the latter, you'll have no Will to the Work, but go to it as a Bear to the ſtake. 1. Be ſure you get Scripture knowledge, a knowledge of God, the object of worſhip, of the Mediator by whom only you muſt have acceſs to the Father, a knowledg of the Holy-Ghoſt that muſt help your infirmities, a knowledg of your ſelves, of Divine Truths, Precepts,<note place="margin">Prov. 19.2.</note> Promiſes; <hi>that the Soul be without knowledg it is not good,</hi> otherwiſe you will Worſhip you know not what, or you care not how, or regard not why; you'll degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into Formality and Superſtition; it's worth nothing, what you find in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19. hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told us of an <hi>Altar</hi> in ver. 19. he tells us

                  <hi>To the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown God?</hi> and therefore it's ſaid, that the Lord ſhall be known to <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the Goſpel-Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, and not only ſo, but the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſhall know the Lord; Savingly, Sincerely, Senſibly, Experimentally (for words of ſenſe denote affection and practice) then and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver till then will they be fit to offer an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; for if men offer the blind for Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is it not Evil?<note place="margin">Mal. 1.8.</note> and if the offerer be blind and Ignorant, is not he Evil? will God accept ſuch a perſon? what cares God for mens Ignorant Devotions?<note place="margin">Hoſ. 4.1.</note> if there be no knowledg of God in the Land, there's no Mercy nor Truth: for ſaving knowledg is the door and window to let in Saving Grace. 2. You muſt allo have a ſaving Principle of Grace in your hearts, a bowed Will, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Conſcience, Sanctified affections, a Soul ſet with a by as Heaven-wards, that you may delight in the Law of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.22.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61695:54"/> and your hearts will not be ingag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, then you will be heartleſs in ſetting about it, and ſoon weary of it, without uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſt; you can do nothing, ſee then that Chriſt dwell in your hearts by Faith;<note place="margin">Eph. 3.17. 1 Joh. 4.16.</note> that's the Miſtical Bond that you be united to him by love, that's the Moral Bond and Ligament, from that Spring flow Holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, delight in God; fear of God; repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Humility, Self-denyal, Zeal, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Graces, without which you will be but cold Worſhipers of God; Set up with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within, or you are Formaliſts at beſt. But you'll ſay, how ſhall we get this principle of Grace? I anſwer, you muſt be convinced, that you have it not by Nature, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not work it in your own hearts,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.8.</note> for <hi>Faith is the gift of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.5.</note> you muſt examine your ſelves whether Faith be in you, you muſt ſtudy and plead the Covenant of Grace,<note place="margin">Jer. 31.33, 34.

               <p>MY laſt work, is the Anſwering of Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Caſes of Conſcience, ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of have been propounded to me, others are ordinarily incident in this point, concerning this Family-Altar, and Sacrifices in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Query, <hi>Whether may an Houſe-Holder take upon him to Preach, expound Scripture, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the Seals of the Covenant, as Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper to the Members of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, ſeeing he is a Prieſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Miniſterial Authoritative teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by vertue of others is one thing, and charitative ſubſervient teaching is another: A Maſter of a Family,<note place="margin">Deut. 11.18, 19, 20, 21. Heb. 5.4.</note> muſt teach all under his Charge as a Maſter, yet not uſurp the Office of a Miniſter, without a juſt due Call: His teaching muſt not be in oppoſition, but in ſubordination to Miniſterial Inſtruction: As Families are Subordinate to Churches:</p>
               <p n="2">2. Maſters of Families muſt not take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that they are not fit for, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume beyond their Capacity, incurring the guilt of proud ſelf-conceitedneſs, or vain oſtentation, as to undertake to interpret the Original, or give the Senſe of dark Prophecy, or obſcure Scriptures, or determine knotty Controverſies: Yet may declare (when it lies in their way) what they have read or
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61695:75"/> heard from Learned Pious Men, or got in publick Preaching.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet it is ſafeſt, ordinarily to paſs by thoſe abſtruſe and difficult points, and inſiſt upon plain, practical, fundamental, catechiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Truths, or take occaſion from the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter read in the Family, to infer ſuch a ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable word, ſuppoſe of admonition; (as I have heard a godly Father ſay) this is for you, look to't, this aims at you in ſuch a caſe, and with ſerious Exhortations preſs it home upon Conſcience: Or inform the ignorant in ſuch or ſuch a point, requiring them to remember it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But as for adminiſtring Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, they may not preſume to do it, being an act of Office: This being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to Chriſts Commiſſion, <hi>Teach and Baptize,</hi> and this is the <hi>Cup of Bleſſing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 28.19, 20. 1 Cor. 10.16. 1 Cor. 11.13.</note> which we [viz. <hi>as Miniſters] bleſs:</hi> And this they receive of the Lord; and are to deliver it to the People: And I find ſeveral Judicious Divines affirming, that Diſpenſing the Seals, is peculiar to an Organized Church, and is proper only to Miniſters rightly Ordained: For the Lords Supper is a Symbol, and mean of publick Communion; not of Families as ſuch! For though Chriſt adminiſtred it to his Family, yet not as a Family, but as a Church: The Judgment and Practice of the Primitive Doctors and Chriſtians, is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proof of this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Query, <hi>Is the Maſter or Governour of the Family, always bound to perform Family Duty?
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61695:76"/> May he not in ſome caſes, Subſtitute another to perform that Office for him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is incumbent upon the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Family, as his proper charge: And it is the fitteſt he do it himſelf, it capable: <hi>David</hi> was a great King, and had much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs abroad,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6.20. Job 1.35.</note> yet returned to <hi>bleſs his Houſe,</hi> and put it not off to a Chaplain: <hi>Job</hi> was the greateſt of all the Men in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> yet he acted perſonally in Family Worſhip: I have heard of a Noble Man in <hi>England,</hi> that though he keep a Chaplain, yet to ſhew his Authority and Duty voluntarily at ſome times himſelf prays with his Family: This is well done:</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet a Chaplain may be made uſe of, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially where the Family is numerous, or when his gifts and graces are more taking and edifying, and he is likely to do more good than the Governour:<note place="margin">Deut. 12.12, 18.</note> It may ſeem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that ſome <hi>Levites</hi> were kept in ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> Families, being oft reckoned with their Sons, Daughters, Servants, it may be in ſome Caſes to perform theſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Duties in the Family:<note place="margin">Judg. 27.13.</note> And ſo Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous <hi>Micah,</hi> had his <hi>Levite</hi>-Chaplain: which he too much boaſted of:</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some have thought, that a Wife in a Family, may in ſome Caſes perform Family-Duty, and that this Honour may be given to the weaker veſſel, to do the Office of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Exerciſe,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3 7.</note> as well as partake in the Government of the Family: doubtleſs ſhe is to pray: And it hath been judged by Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

But I am not poſitive herein, but leave it to others conſideration.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And why may not a Servant, a Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of the houſe, ſuch as <hi>Eliezer, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Servant, or <hi>Obadiah, Ahabs</hi> Servant, pray in the Family? Eſpecially in theſe caſes, when the Maſter gives him, not only liberty, but a call to that Performance, yea requeſts him to pray in the Family. 2. When that Servant hath gifts to qualifie him for ſuch a work and is not expoſed to the ſcorn and contempt of his fellows. 3.

We are not bound to Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted places for Family-Duty: In this you may uſe your liberty: In Goſpel-times, God ſtands not ſo much upon the place of Worſhip, as the quality of Worſhippers, and manner of Worſhipping:<note place="margin">Joh. 4 23, 24. 1 Tim. 2.8.</note> Look at the frame of your Hearts, as before deſcribed, and fear not En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, where ever you be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet the Circumſtance of place may be duely weighed, if you live amongſt Lions, Mockers, Scorners of Religon, though you muſt maintain your profeſſion of God's name in your Families, as <hi>Daniel did,</hi> yet it's a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable point, whether you may not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times retire from open violence into ſome private place. But there may be a greater reaſon for retirement than that, <hi>viz.</hi> To a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61695:79"/> the ſuſpicion of Hypocriſy,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.5.</note> and Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory which was the <hi>Pharieſes</hi> great fall; or you may withdraw into ſome diſtant place from the ſtreet, to avoid diſturbance by hurrys, Tumults and Confuſions that may diſtract you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But let the place be ſo known to the Family as all may repair to it, as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, at the time of prayer, be it dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-houſe, parlour, Chamber;<note place="margin">Dan. 6.10.</note> as <hi>Daniel</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved ſome convenient room, called a <hi>Chamber</hi> for his Family-Devotion, So may You.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For voice, it's true God is an all-ſeeing Spirit, and men may ſpeak to God, when they ſpeak not a word, as <hi>Moſes, Hanna, Nehemiah;</hi> prayer is the motion of the will to God, but in Family-prayer 'tis otherwiſe, men have Bodies and Tongues and Ears, and cannot underſtand others conceptions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a vocal articulate ſound; what you pray muſt be audible, elſe they cannot joyn with you, or be edified by you: only ſee your Hearts go along with your Lips; and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the ſaying of Solomon, <hi>The words of Wiſe-Men are heard in quiet, more than the cry of him that ruleth among Fools;</hi> Eccl. 9.17. I know it referrs to Wiſe Counſels, not prayers, but ſome may pray more affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly with a low Voice, than others with loud clamours: Yea poſſibly you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand your thoughts better in the former, than latter; ſee you be ſerious, and your voice Audible and Intelligible, not Mumbling your
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61695:80"/> prayers, ſo that your Family cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand you or know what you mean.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Caſe is, <hi>Whether is a form of Prayer Lawfull, or whether may an Houſe-holder uſe a Form of Prayer, or may others joyn with him in the uſe thereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Our moſt ſolid judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of thoſe called Puritans, do not judg forms of Prayer abſolutly unlawfull; Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Preſton <hi>Saints daily Exerciſe,</hi> p. 80, 81, 82.</note>
                  <q>I think there is none here that doubt of it, but that a Set Form of Prayer may be uſed; you know, Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a Form, — there were certain <hi>Pſalmes</hi> that were Prayers uſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, — ſtill in all times the Church had Set-Forms; I know no objection againſt it of weight, &amp;c. Mr. <hi>Hilderſham,</hi> (the Oracle of his time) ſaith,<note place="margin">Hilderſham on Pſal. 51. Lect. 12. p. 63. See 3. Arg. for forms.</note> I dare not deny but a weak Chriſtian may uſe the help of a good Prayer-Book in this Caſe; better to pray on a Book than not to pray at all; certainly it is the Spirit of Errour that hath taught the World otherwiſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <q>Yet theſe worthy men affirm truely that every Chriſtian, even the meaneſt and weakeſt hath the gift and Spirit of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.14.</note> So ſaith the latter of theſe Worthys, and muſt not <hi>neglect the gift that's in him;</hi> Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> ſaith, there is no man that hath any work of Grace in his heart, but he is enabled in ſome meaſure to pray, without a ſet Form of prayer; there was never any man in any extream want, but he knew how to expreſs himſelf, where he had liberty to ſpeak.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:61695:80"/>3. But Yet conſidering that ſome Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (though truely Gracious) may for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be very raw, and unfit to open their Caſes to God methodically, or in apt words, and conſidering it's before a Family that a man is to be the Mouth of, and conſidering that unmeet and undigeſted expreſſions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an Ordinance of God to contempt; I could adviſe ſome Chriſtians, before they pray with others, to premeditate, and duly weigh what they are to ſay to God, and think of a proper method, and ſome Scriptural ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, to produce them in Prayer, as I have before directed:</p>
               <p n="4">4. As I doubt not the lawfulneſs of a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in a Family joyning with ſuch a Prayer, if the matter be ſound and Orthodox, ſo I queſtion but ſuch a Maſter as Conſcientiouſly uſeth this practice, will ſo increaſe in gifts and abilities, that in due time, he will caſt away thoſe Crutches, and learn to go on profitably in daily Family Exerciſe, to the edification of all that joyn with him: So that in the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and humble uſe of theſe means, many nauſeous Tautologies, and needleſs Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies will be paired off, which offended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent ears: The Worthy Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> ſaith, <q>a Child that cannot go, may have a prop to help it; but we muſt not always be Children, we muſt not always uſe that help:</q>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Caſe is, <hi>What if the Houſholder or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour be looſe and careleſs, poſſibly comes home full of Drink, yet will Pray, though in no fit caſe for it, or
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61695:81"/> he is unſound at heart, Prays but coldly, formally, may I joyn?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Thy acceptance with God, depends not on the ſtate of him that Prays, nor on his zeal, but upon thy non acting of Faith in Chriſt, it thou be upright in joyning with the words, and endeavoured to lift up thy Heart to God, the Lord may graciouſly entertain thee,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.5. Rom. 14.12.</note> though the perſon praying may be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected: For <hi>every one ſhall bear his own burden,</hi> and <hi>give an account of himſelf to God;</hi> Not of others that we joyn with:</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet if thou beeſt certainly aſſured that the party Praying ſpeaks Nonſenſe or Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, in ſtead of Praying, thou art bound in Conſcience to ſhew thy diſlike of it, leſt God be Diſhonoured, and Offended with the whole Family, the Man hardned in ſin, thy own Conſcience defiled, and thy ſelt in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of playing the Hypocrite, in pretending to joyn with what thy Soul abhors: In this caſe thou muſt withdraw, and get alone, and mourn for it:</p>

                  <note place="margin">2 Kin. 5.13. 1 Sam. 25.37.</note>3. And 'tis alſo thy Duty, humbly and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly to take a fit ſeaſon to ſpeak to thy Maſter, as <hi>Naamans</hi> Servants did to him, when they ſaw him out, and you know it did good: And <hi>Abigail</hi> told her Husband <hi>Nabal</hi> of his fault and danger, and <hi>his heart dyed within him:</hi> who can tell what good ſuch a word in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may do? He may think of it afterwards, <hi>Jonathans</hi> Preaching <hi>Davids</hi> Caſe,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 19.4, 6.</note> with his Paſſionate Father <hi>Saul,</hi> did good for a while: If you come to a Father or Maſter humbly
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61695:81"/> and ſubmiſſively, not ſaucily and malapartly, you may win upon them, and if you can ſay little, yet if you burſt out into tears for their ſin, it may prove as convincing Rhetorick to them as King <hi>Edward</hi>'s weeping was to Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Ridley,</hi> denying his Siſter <hi>Mary</hi> liberty for Maſs; who ſaid. <hi>The King had more Divinity in his little finger than they had in their whole body.</hi>
               </p>

If ſtill there be no Remedy or Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, tho' thou muſt not with curſed <hi>Cham,</hi> diſcover thy Fathers or Maſters nakedneſs, if otherwiſe it may be helpt, yet thou may'ſt or muſt acquaint a godly Miniſter, or Chriſtian friend, ask their advice, and (if that be judged expedient) that they may ſpeak to thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Maſter, with as much ſecreſie as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and this runs parallel to our Lord's Rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16. Who knows but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction may faſten? and if he be obſtinate, he will leave off his praying in a little time; for his ſinning will make him give over pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or his praying his ſinning.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Caſe. <hi>Suppoſe I be caſt into a graceleſs and prayerleſs family, how muſt I do, or what is my duty?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Examine thy grounds and ends in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither; conſider thy Call, if thy Parents fixed thee there as an Apprentice, quiet thy ſelf in God's diſpoſe; make good uſe of this Providence; if thou came thither voluntarily, without due conſideration, be humbled for ſin, beg pardon, make ſure of a friend above.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Uſe all lawful means to remove into a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61695:82"/> more wholeſom Air; I ſay to thee as the Apoſtle to a godly Servant,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Art thou called, being a Servant, care not for it; but if thou may'ſt be made free, uſe it rather.</hi> Methinks God ſaith to you as once to <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 16.21, 24, 26, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Depart, I pray you, from the Tents of theſe wicked men.</hi> It's a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ground doth not cleave in ſunder, or ſome Judgment comes not down upon ſuch praverleſs Families.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Humbly propound ſome Expedients for Remedy: See if any other Member in the Family will undertake that work, or whether the Governour will give you leave to pray in the Family; and behave your ſelves ſo holily and winningly, that the good conceit of Superiours or Equals may be a prologue and preparative to that work.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If all this avail not for Family-worſhip, and neceſſity detains you there, as you love your Souls, ſpend more time, take more pains in ſecret; <hi>[Abi in Cellam &amp; dic, miſerere mei]</hi> get into your Cell, and ſay, Lord have mercy on me, as the old Monk ſaid to <hi>Luther;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 13.17.</note> or as <hi>Jeremiah, If ye will not hear it, my Soul ſhall weep in ſecret places for your Pride.</hi> Pray for your own Soul, that you may not periſh with others; pray for the Family, and all the Members thereof, Governours and Governed; be not diſcourraged with their ſcoffs; who knows what the Event may prove?</p>
               <p n="10">10 Caſe. <hi>What if I be caſt into a praying-family, what uſe ſhall I make thereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Give glory to God: admire his wiſe and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Providence: It's not the Lot of all young people: Think and ſay, Lord, who am I to enjoy this Priviledge? this is a bleſſed place,<note place="margin">Judg. 6.37. Gen. 28.17.</note> a place of bleſſings: This Fleece is wet with Dew, when others are dry: This is none other but the Houſe of God, and this is the Gate of Heaven: Bleſſed be God that hath caſt my Lot here.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Joyn in family-prayer: Be not needleſly abſent; but do not content your ſelves with bodily preſence, or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, but ſee to it, that your hearts alſo joyn with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, elſe you play the Hypocrites: And when you go forth, and ſet up Families of your own, uſe the ſame pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, but with the ſame ſpirit of your pious Maſters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Improve this ſtock of your Relation's prayers. A Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61695:82"/> may lay up an Eſtate for his Child in Bills and Bonds, which may prove a good Portion. The Corn ſown in the Field, is as good as that in the Garner, in ſome reſpects bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! The Father ſows, the Child reaps a bleſſed Crop! God forbid that I ſhould loſe my Child's Portion for want of looking after it: Lord cut not off the Entail of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Covenant: Oh hear the many cryes he put up for me in my hearing!</p>
               <p n="4">4. Behave your ſelves ſuitably to that Family where ſo gracious a Providence hath caſt you: God forbid you ſhould be a ſcoffing <hi>Iſhmael</hi> in an <hi>Abraham</hi>'s houſe, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane <hi>Eſau</hi> in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s, a Rebellious <hi>Abſalom,</hi> or a filthy <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in holy <hi>David</hi>'s Family: You diſgrace the ways of God more than others, when it ſhall be ſaid, See what a Beaſt was bred in a praying-family: You greatly diſcredit your Breeding, and ſink your ſelves deeper in Hell: God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty open your Eyes, awake your Conſciences, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form your Converſation; that you may walk worthy of God to all well pleaſing.</p>
               <p>I have now done with this great Subject of a due Erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Family-Altar, and offering Goſpel Sacrifices to the Lord; and oh that there were of theſe Altars ſet up in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dwelling-houſe,<note place="margin">Cant. 3.6.</note> and Divine Incenſe aſcending like <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Smoke</hi> Heaven wards.</p>
               <p>I have but a word of Incouragement to weak, but willing Souls, that ſet upon Family-worſhip, but meet with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſcouragements from without, but eſpecially within, that their hearts are apalled, and are ready to give hack, and ſay, Will God accept ſuch poor, lean, and lank Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, ſo dead, heartleſs, lifeleſs? I do no good, I get no good, I might as well give over, I am oft ſo wofully indiſpoſed for duty, that I might as well let it alone.</p>
               <p>O my Friends! look on this as a temptation, and beware of it; ſtrive againſt it, rouze up your ſpirits.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, you are not the firſt or only perſons that Satan hath reſiſted in duty; for even <hi>Joſhua</hi> the High-Prieſt (a Type of Chriſt) had Satan ſtanding at his right hand,<note place="margin">Zech. 3.13. 2 Cor. 2.11.</note> to reſiſt h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> and he had too much advantage againſt him; for, <hi>he was cloathed with filthy garments:</hi> And our weakneſs is Satan's ſtrength, our guilt his advantage: But our <hi>Jehovah</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee:</hi> The Devil makes ſpots, and then accuſeth us of our ſpots; but Chriſt wipes them off.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:61695:83"/>2. Our Lord takes well your good will to do, though you can do but little:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.12.</note> The <hi>imprimis</hi> of a willing mind is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though your following <hi>Items</hi> be few and poor: <hi>The Lord is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6.10.</note> 
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe duties we perform to the Lord with labour and hard ſtruggling. It's the obſervation of precious Mr. <hi>Hilderſham; Think not,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">On Pſal. 51. p. 65.</note> ſaith he <hi>(Beloved) that thoſe prayers only are pleaſing to God, wherein we pleaſe our ſelves best, or which we perform with moſt facility and aptneſs of mind and ſpeech; no, no, when we can perform this duty in obedience to God, even againſt our own diſpoſition, and oppoſitions in our own heares; theſe are the prayers that are most acceptable to God; as</hi> Abraham's <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> Gen. 22.12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By uſing and exerciſing little grace, improving ſmall ability to pray, you will encreaſe it, and will more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably carry on the work;<note place="margin">Mat. 25.29.</note> ſo the Text; <hi>To every one that hath (i. e.</hi> by employing it, he ſhews that he hath, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the unprofitable Servant had a Talent alſo) <hi>ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance.</hi> Sick perſons, whoſe appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is weakned, by eating provoke and recover them, one morſel drawing down another: You'll find this true in ſpirituals.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The weaker you think your ſelves, and the more likely to depend on the right means of your acceptance, that is the Spirit of Chriſt for aſſiſtance, and the Merit and Interceſſion of Chriſt for entertainment: For alas! you find you have no fluſh of gifts to fill the Sails, or height of enlargement to carry with full gale to God; you are emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, and your Plumes quite fallen as to any thing you do, and therefore conclude, you are too low to reach God, and your duties quite loſt, except your perſons and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances be found in Chriſt.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.9.</note> I ſhall therefore conclude this whole Diſcourſe with that ſweet Text, that's worth a world, without the benefit of which, all our Altars and Sacrifices are Ciphers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. <hi>And another Angel came and ſtood at the Altar, having a golden Cenſer, and there was given unto him much Iecenſe, that he ſhould offer it with the prayers of all Saints, upon the golden Altar, which was before the Throne.</hi>
